<note>
i install selenium
i copied url of lens.google.com, i inspect the field, everything in it was changing dynamically 
except placeholder, so with some code the google lens get opened with a url like image of numbers captcha and it also click the text,
after that clicking text, there is another button "Select all text" for that we access through text because
every varaible/attributes get changed dynamically. so after writing more code, the button code clicked and
can see the text, i hover on it by inspecting and i see that div class does'nt change which was //div[@class="VIH6Y AbOGud
and we find it by find element tag h1 because it contains the result
